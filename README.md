# Paper-Experiment-Code
This project supports the experimental validation in Chapter 4 of the accompanying paper, implementing a blockchain-based dynamic pricing model for data products. It includes a Solidity smart contract (DataPrice.sol) and a Python testing script (web3DataPrice.py) designed to run on a local Ethereum testnet via Ganache.
